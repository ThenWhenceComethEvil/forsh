The (in)direct threading model of FORTH may actually have a semi-equivalency in
its bash version. Need to better understand how FORTH actually do... but some
parallel may help with execution speed.

Can maybe just have everything be a function call. They're not crazy spensive,
relative to the time to reading the initial file. 200k/s (with variable
arguments) isn't bad.

May be a faster way.

Things to avoid (in order):
- file I/O
- subshells

Things to kinda avoid
- eval

Things to actively encourage using:
- push/pop from index arrays
- setting/unsetting associative arrays
